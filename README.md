## Introduction
Welcome to the **Introduction to Python** repository! This collection is aimed at providing a comprehensive overview of Python programming for beginners. Whether you're new to coding or looking to refresh your skills, you'll find valuable resources and exercises here.

## First Steps
Here you'll find the initial steps of my Python learning journey. Each file represents a different fundamental topic in Python:

1. [1rstPythoncode.py](1rstPythoncode.py) - My very first Python code.
2. [2.pythonAsCalculator.py](2.pythonAsCalculator.py) - Using Python as a calculator.
3. [3.VariableAssignment.py](3.VariableAssignment.py) - Variable assignment basics.
4. [4.CalculationsWithVariables.py](4.CalculationsWithVariables.py) - Calculations with variables.
5. [5.OtherVariableTypes.py](5.OtherVariableTypes.py) - Exploring different variable types.
6. [6.OperationsWithOtherTypes.py](6.OperationsWithOtherTypes.py) - Operations with various types.
7. [7.OperationsWithOtherTypes.py](7.OperationsWithOtherTypes.py) - Continuing with operations.

## Python Lists
Today, I'll be working on the following topics related to Python lists:
1. Introduction to Python Lists
2. Accessing List Elements
3. List Slicing
4. Modifying Lists
5. List Methods
6. List Comprehensions
7. Nested Lists

As I progress through each topic, I'll add the corresponding files and explanations here.
