Calculations with variables
You've now created a savings variable, so let's start saving!

Instead of calculating with the actual values, you can use variables instead.

How much money would you have saved four months from now, if you saved $10 each month?

Create a variable monthly_savings, equal to 10 and num_months, equal to 4.
Multiply monthly_savings by num_months and assign it to new_savings.
Print the value of new_savings.

"""

# Create the variables monthly_savings and num_months
monthly_savings = 10
num_months = 4

# Multiply monthly_savings and num_months
new_savings = num_months * monthly_savings

# Print new_savings
print(new_savings)
